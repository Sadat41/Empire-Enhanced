## ‚ùìHow It Works
**Empire Enhanced** injects JavaScript into CSGOEmpire and listens to WebSocket data for real-time item monitoring.
To use it:
- Run a local Node.js server that filters and processes data
- Provide your CSGOEmpire [API key](https://csgoempire.com/trading/apikey)
- The extension UI connects to the server and lets you configure:
  -  Target items + optional float range
  -  Notification sounds
  -  Site-wide theming
  -  Price and keychain filters

All settings are saved using `chrome.storage` and `server-settings.json`.
