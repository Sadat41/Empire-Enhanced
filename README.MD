## ‚ùìHow It Works

Empire Enhanced operates by injecting JavaScript into the target website and listening to websocket data streams from CSGOEmpire. It intercepts and processes real-time data such as item listings, wear values, and pricing information.

Upon installation, the extension adds a toolbar icon that opens a popup interface. From this UI, users can:
- Add or remove items in the tracking list
- Adjust price and float filters
- Preview and select notification sounds
- Enable or disable site theming

Data from the popup interface is stored using `chrome.storage` or equivalent local storage APIs. This allows settings and tracked items to persist between sessions. The local server syncs with the extension to ensure notifications and filters are consistent and reliable.
