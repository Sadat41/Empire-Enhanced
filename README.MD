## Key Features
**Empire Enhanced** is built to extend and streamline the experience on [CSGOEmpire](https://csgoempire.com) through a set of practical and performance-focused tools:
Custom Item Tracking  
- Track any item by name using the Item Target List. Supports partial keyword matching and optional float (wear) value filtering.
Real-Time Notifications  
- Receive instant alerts when matching items appear in the marketplace. Includes customizable notification sounds with live preview.
Persistent Filters and Settings  
- Price ranges, keychain thresholds, and item lists are saved locally and restored automatically after browser or system restarts.
heming
- The extension offers different themes ("Nebula" and "Shooting Star") for both the popup and the CSGOEmpire website itself.
Modular and Scalable Design  
- Features are designed as self-contained modules to allow for easy expansion without modifying core files.

## ‚ùìHow It Works
**Empire Enhanced** injects JavaScript into CSGOEmpire and listens to WebSocket data for real-time item monitoring.
To use it:
- Run a local Node.js server that filters and processes data
- Provide your CSGOEmpire [API key](https://csgoempire.com/trading/apikey)
- The extension UI connects to the server and lets you configure:
  -  Target items + optional float range
  -  Notification sounds
  -  Site-wide theming
  -  Price and keychain filters

All settings are saved using `chrome.storage` and `server-settings.json`.
