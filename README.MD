## ❓ How does Empire-Enhanced work?

Empire-Enhanced works by [briefly explain its core technical approach, e.g., "injecting custom JavaScript into web pages," "modifying network requests," "providing a customizable overlay"]. It operates by listening for specific browser events and then applies your configured enhancements.

Upon installation, Empire-Enhanced will [explain initial user interaction, e.g., "add an icon to your browser toolbar," "require certain permissions for full functionality"]. Clicking the toolbar icon will typically open a popup or a dedicated dashboard page where you can [explain main user actions, e.g., "toggle features on/off," "adjust settings," "view activity logs"].

Our robust architecture ensures minimal performance impact while delivering powerful results.

```javascript
// Example: A simplified snippet showing core functionality logic
// This would typically reside in background.js or a dedicated module.
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
    if (message.action === "enhancePage") {
        // Example: Perform some DOM manipulation or data fetching
        chrome.scripting.executeScript({
            target: { tabId: sender.tab.id },
            function: applyPageEnhancements
        });
        sendResponse({ status: "Enhancement initiated" });
    }
});

function applyPageEnhancements() {
    // Logic to modify the current page's content or behavior
    console.log("Empire-Enhanced: Applying enhancements to current page.");
    // Example: document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'darkgrey';
    // More complex logic for your specific features...
}
