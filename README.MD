- The extension offers different themes ("Nebula" and "Shooting Star") for both the popup and the CSGOEmpire website itself.
Modular and Scalable Design  
- Features are designed as self-contained modules to allow for easy expansion without modifying core files.

## ‚ùìHow It Works
**Empire Enhanced** injects JavaScript into CSGOEmpire and listens to WebSocket data for real-time item monitoring.
To use it:
- Run a local Node.js server that filters and processes data
- Provide your CSGOEmpire [API key](https://csgoempire.com/trading/apikey)
- The extension UI connects to the server and lets you configure:
  -  Target items + optional float range
  -  Notification sounds
  -  Site-wide theming
  -  Price and keychain filters

All settings are saved using `chrome.storage` and `server-settings.json`.

### Step 1: Set Up the Backend Server

#### 1. Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sadat41/Empire-Enhanced.git
```
#### 2. Navigate to the server directory:
``` bash
cd Empire-Enhanced/server
```
#### 3. Install required packages:
```bash
npm install
```
#### 4. Open server.js and replace the placeholder API key:
```bash
const CONFIG = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_CSGOEMPIRE_API_KEY",
  ...
};
```
#### 5. Start the server
```bash
npm run dev  # For development (auto restarts)
```
or
```bash
npm start     # For production
```
#### 6. Visit `http://localhost:3001/health` to confirm it's running.

### Step 2: Load the Browser Extension

For Chrome:
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable Developer Mode (top-right)
- Click Load unpacked
- Select the `/extension` folder inside the project

For Firefox:
- Visit `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
- Click Load Temporary Add-on
- Choose the `manifest.json` inside the `/extension` folder

### Step 3: Use the Extension
Once both the server and extension are running:
- Click the Empire Enhanced icon in your browser toolbar
- Use the popup to:
- Add items to the Item Target List
- Set float and price filters
- Choose notification sounds
- Enable site theming (Nebula or Shooting Star)

The extension will automatically connect to `http://localhost:3001` and start monitoring items based on your configuration.
